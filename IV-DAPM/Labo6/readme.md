The sixth Mobile Development laboratory -- the 23rd of March, 2020

From this laboratory I have learned how to use the Shared Preferences in AndroidStudio and how to use the intents.

The exercises were not difficult, the first one was the easiest of course, but I didn't bother styling the save button with the Android icon, I dould not find it in the predefined resources.

The second one was easy, I created the second class and implemented the methods but I forgot to actually save the text in the save method, and I discovered that while doing the fourth exercise and that's the reason I am late.

The third exercise was simple, I later added another TextView to show the extra specified in the seventh exercise.

Well, the fourth and the fifth exercises surely were the longest because I couldn't figure out why it doesn't print the saved data...

The seventh one was easy as well (we talked about Intents last Friday at the course).

I skipped the sixth exercise and I noticed it only now, while I was writing the readme, so I will attach both photos for the early version and the final version of this laboratory.

The most recent photos are 5.jpeg, 6.jpeg and 7.jpeg.
