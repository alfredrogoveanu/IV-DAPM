The eighth Mobile Development laboratory -- the 6th of April, 2020

I didn't like this laboratory because the main problem I had while writing both exercises was an import issue I couldn't solve (dependencies which were set bad or I don't know) related to this:

import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;

I tried changing them to androidx but, despite the flawless compilation, the application ultimately crashed on the smartphone. I had no solution but to download the final projects and and compile them and they actually ran and didn't have that import android.support.v7 problem. I suppose this comes because they were written with old SDKs or older Android Studio versions... Stackoverflow wasn't helpful either, much to my disappointment.

However, this v7 problem is related to the RecyclerView and AppCompatActivity and not to SQLite, so that's good, I guess...

Speaking of SQLite, this laboratory was useful because I learnt how to use SQLite and make such apps. The first tutorial was about how to build an event management app - and it works fine with one small issue: the update work doesn't work as planned - and a notes app, the tutorial link can be found in Ana's document, and it's simply a notes app, you can write countless notes, but no delete option.

The video for exercise 3 can be found in the Labo8e3 folder.
