The seventh Mobile Development laboratory -- the 30th of March, 2020

So... I have to say that the first exercise was interesting, I've never thought I would do something like that (the text-to-speech app), but I realised that I was only calling Google's API. The tutorial on TutorialsPoint was very useful. The app runs without problems, the only problem is that the recorder can't record the mic, also, sometimes the API goes nuts and instead of 'another test', it said 'anadrol Trust'... For the last sentence, I forgot what I wanted to say, something with 'nonsense' for sure because of the last API response.

The video is in this folder. It works with VLC (tested it!).

The second exercise, well, I had problems with it because in the activity_main.xml I've set the name atribute badly, forgetting to select FragmentOne and I witnessed the app crashing and crashing at the start... Now everything's fine, however I had to select the old packages for Fragment, FragmentManager and FragmentTransaction. Nevertheless, the tutorial was super easy to follow.

The video for the second exercise is located in the second exercise's folder.

In conclusion, I've learned how to create a TTS app, what is a fragment and how to use them.
