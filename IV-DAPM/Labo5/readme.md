1. CHALLENGES

Well, I finished the project in due time, I had no problems and I finished all the exercises, it took around one hour and a half, and another 20 minutes for the build and correcting the errors in the code (just two).

2. Well, the first project is very similar to what Alex taught us last Friday at course, we built an app which listed a pre-defined car list where we could add afterwards how many cars we want.

Important: for the 5th exercise, the method presented by you wasn't efficient, so I had to modify it, using the 'recycling' method, I have to credit Alex for this, he presented it to us. Also, I made the use of tag more efficient.

He also spoke us about the methods (getCount, getItem etc.), which were super easy to implement.

Otherwise, it wasn't a complicated project.

The last 'exercise' wasn't complicated either, we placed images in grids, similar to what we did last time with the TicTacToe game, but now we used lists and the implementation (in Java) was different.
